# LXmini Full Range Driver Alternatives

There was one question that could never escape the back of my mind since I
have built my desktop version of LXmini—is it possible to fix [the
distortion issue](/2024/07/lxmini-desktop-version-lxdesktoppartii.html)
with the full range driver? This issue was also the major negative point in
[the Erin's review of
LXmini](https://www.erinsaudiocorner.com/loudspeakers/linkwitz_lx_mini/#harmonic-distortion).

Because the full range driver used for LXmini—[SEAS
FU10RB](https://www.madisoundspeakerstore.com/approx-4-fullrange/seas-prestige-fu10rb-h1600-04-4-full-range/)—was
released 15 years ago, I thought, perhaps there are any better alternatives
on the market that have been developed with modern materials and better
technologies, so they can provide more even (without the prominent bump
between **1** and **2 kHz**), and hopefully achieve a **10 dB** or better
improvement in the overall distortion level? I checked distortion
measurements for various drivers available on
[Zaph|Audio](https://zaphaudio.com/blog) and at Erin's Audio Corner, but
could not find any small "full range" drivers that would come up as
obviously superior to SEAS FU10RB in terms of distortion. One notable
exception are drivers made by [Purifi](https://purifi-audio.com/), however,
with the current global trade situation getting them in the USA is very
costly.

## The Candidates

Scanning through the available stock of MadiSound and Parts Express,
I have came up with a very scarce list of possible candidates for high
fidelity full range 3"/4" drivers:

 - [SEAS
   MU10RB-SL](https://www.madisoundspeakerstore.com/approx-4-midrange/seas-mu10rb-sl-h1658-04-4-woven-poly-cone-midrange/)—this
   is the "midrange driver" of the LX521 speaker (I guess, the "SL" suffix
   are the initials of S. Linkwitz). But the fun fact is that is has the
   same specs as FU10RB, except for the properties of the suspension. The
   suspension in the "midrange" version is stiffer, which limits the cone
   excursion, and as a result the driver has poorer bass. But the bass is
   not an issue for its use in LXmini—there is a woofer for that, and I was
   thinking that perhaps the difference in suspension makes a positive
   effect on reducing distortion (spoiler: not so much!). I haven't found
   any reputable measurements for this driver so decided to try to measure
   it myself.

 - [MarkAudio
   MAOP-5](https://www.madisoundspeakerstore.com/mark-audio-maop/mark-audio-maop-5-101mm-magnetic-arc-oxidized-full-range-matched-pair/). This
   driver looks a bit exotic—it has no ["spider" suspension
   part](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrodynamic_speaker_driver#Suspension)
   (the corrugated fabric supporting the cone), so in contrast to
   MU10RB-SL, this driver has **less** suspension force than FU10RB. I was
   a bit suspicious about the consequences of this design decision, but I
   have found no measurements for the distortion to reveal the effect of
   this approach so it was interesting to try to measure this driver
   myself.

 - [Tang Band
   W3-1878](https://www.parts-express.com/Tang-Band-W3-1878-3-Full-Range-Driver-264-902)
   also has an unusual look thanks to the massive motor and a specially
   designed "phase plug", which reminds me of grilles that are used on some
   measurement microphones. This driver [was
   measured](https://www.diymobileaudio.com/threads/tang-band-w3-1878-3-full-range-driver-klippel-results.116483/)
   by the same Erin on a Klippel jig back in 2011, but the results were not
   cross-posted to his site. In the post Erin mentions that his distorion
   measurements are "relative", which most probably means they are not
   calibrated to a specific SPL standard, and frankly I did not understand
   how to read this particular distortion graph, but from Erin's own
   comments the distortion is on a good level.

And that's basically it! I have used two more drivers for comparison:

 - One is obviously the FU10RB itself, to make sure that I'm using its
   measurements taken under the same conditions as from the contenders.
 - And the midrange driver that I had recovered from a broken [Cambridge
   Audio Minx
   Go](https://supportarchive.cambridgeaudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/201010021-Minx-Go-Quick-Start-Guide)
   portable speaker. It is build as a "full cone", and the cone is made of
   paper. This one I used as an "anchor" in my measurements—it would be a
   miracle if it could actually beat any of the speaker drivers above, and
   the "miracle" would mean that my measurements have gone wrong.

## Measurement Setup

I used my QuantAsylum stack consisting of the original QA401 analyzer,
QA460 transducer driver, QA492 microphone preamp (this model is relatively
new), and Earthworks M30 microphone. I powered both the QA460 and QA492
from a portable Jackery battery because my mains power is rather noisy, and
the laptop was also running on battery power. Still, initially I had some
issues with the mains-induced noise which I was [asking about on the
QuantAsylum
forum](https://forum.quantasylum.com/t/qa472-picking-up-mains-noise/2089).
As that thread indicates, I traced the issue down to a poorly shielded USB
cable which I used to power the QA492. Also, after the conversation with
Matt of QuantAsylum, I obtained shorting BNC plugs and used them to cover
up any unused inputs both on QA401 and Q492. This has reduced electrical
noise to the minimum.

Since [Earthworks
M30](https://earthworksaudio.com/measurement-microphones/m30/) goes beyond
the standard **20 kHz** range, I was running the measurements up to
**35 kHz** and was using **192 kHz** sampling rate on QA401. I was only
using the log sweep method which is [sufficient to get basic understanding
of the non-linearities](https://www.melaudia.net/zdoc/sweepSine.PDF) in the
measured system. I did not have enough spare time to run the stepped sine
method with sufficient resolution, and I was interested in making relative
comparisons, so using the log sweep was fine.

## Impedance, Sensitivity, and Efficiency

First, I measured for each driver its impedance, sensitivity, and acoustic
radiation efficiency.

Measuring impedance is straightforward with QA460. Below is the summary
graph for all drivers:

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhRkCKdzCmgrFQP4vFHZhFiXB9YbAfrZ8rFPkfcrUhtbNFJI9fei64zFnWxPimpO5dpbdm2QNiVHPBMmk-iGgR7aEcyTRGSPRGY3NSQkYPMeCt7CwyQUkPXLRjC4j3hdiyhe19fkjIZPQgc4Ale2zuxZl2C9bfhvrWMM5mtSkOAoEvc1wHeh4MrAk99jtlR/s16000/Impedance-All.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhRkCKdzCmgrFQP4vFHZhFiXB9YbAfrZ8rFPkfcrUhtbNFJI9fei64zFnWxPimpO5dpbdm2QNiVHPBMmk-iGgR7aEcyTRGSPRGY3NSQkYPMeCt7CwyQUkPXLRjC4j3hdiyhe19fkjIZPQgc4Ale2zuxZl2C9bfhvrWMM5mtSkOAoEvc1wHeh4MrAk99jtlR/s657/Impedance-All.png)

The impedance plots are abbreviated as follows:
 - **CA** is the Cambridge Audio driver;
 - **FU** is the SEAS FU10RB (the original driver of LXmini);
 - **MA** is the Mark Audio MAOP-5;
 - **MU** is the SEAS MU10RB-SL (the bass-reduced version of FU10RB);
 - **TB** is the Tang Band W3-1878.

We can see that both **MU10RB-SL** and **MAOP-5** have a nominal **4 Ohm**
impedance. The **FU10RB** is also **4 Ohm** nominally, but the actual
impedance is more like **6 Ohm**. And both **W3-1878** and the **CA**
speakers are honest **8 Ohm** drivers, with **CA** being a true "midrange"
driver has steeply increasing impedance above the midrange.

Sensitivity measurement was done by by applying to the driver under test a
**1 kHz** test tone with **1 V** RMS amplitude, and measuring the resulting
SPL from **1 meter** distance. Due to no-baffle mounting the result is
lower than the "official" sensitivity spec. The difference between the
drivers is not very critical because I use a 100 Watt amplifier and
listening to the speakers from **70–100 cm** distance, so even an **8 Ohm**
driver can work well assuming that it is efficient acoustically. Below are
my results:

| Driver               | SPL dBA (1kHz/1V/1m) |
|:---------------------|:---------------------|
| Cambridge Audio (CA) | 60                   |
| FU10RB (FU)          | 62                   |
| MAOP-5 (MA)          | 74                   |
| MU10RB-SL (MU)       | 68                   |
| W3-1878 (TB)         | 68                   |

It's interesting that **MAOP-5** despite having the same impedance at
**1 kHz** as the **MU10RB-SL** ends up being louder. However, the
**FU10RB** is also quieter than **W3-1878** (TB) despite that the former
has lower impedance. Is it because the non-linearity in the **1–2 kHz**
region causes losses in acoustic transfer? The Cambridge Audio driver is
unsurprisingly the quietest because at **1 kHz** it has effective impedance
**16 Ohm**.

And this brings us to acoustic radiation efficiency. In this test I checked
what is the SPL level for the same **1 kHz** test tone at the same distance
of **1 m**, but this time the level of the electrical input for each driver
was adjusted to achieve **105 dB** SPL at the **5 mm** distance from the
driver's cone. Note that this is different from the sensitivity, and
characterizes the ability of the cone to work efficiently as an ideal
piston.

| Driver               | SPL dBA (1kHz/1m)    |
|:---------------------|:---------------------|
| Cambridge Audio (CA) | 66                   |
| FU10RB (FU)          | 72                   |
| MAOP-5 (MA)          | 73                   |
| MU10RB-SL (MU)       | 72                   |
| W3-1878 (TB)         | 65                   |

Here, both SEAS drivers and **MAOP-5** show almost the same result, while
both **W3-1878** and the **CA** driver are **6 dB** worse.  The point of
measuring the radiation efficiency is that even if one driver has lower
distortion than another, and both have the same sensitivity, still due to
lower efficiency one of the drivers has to be driven with higher voltage
relative to another driver in order to achieve the same SPL at the
listening position.

## Impulse and Frequency Response

Now the results from a logsweep. Since I was using the driver in an open
configuration, the same way as it is mounted in LXmini, and my room is
small, I was measuring the logsweep in the close proximity of the driver
cone—about **5 mm**.

Below are impulse and step responses of **CA** and **W3-1878** drivers:

We can see that **CA** driver is seriously damped and the impulse decays
quickly. While **W3-1878** is also damped well, it exhibits quicker back
and forth motion, allowing for a wider high frequency extension.

It's interesting to compare the SEAS "siblings":

They look similar, yet the "midrange" **MU10RB-SL** exhibits more back and
forth motion about **200 μs** after the initial impulse, but then the
oscillations become less severe, although the overall step response ends up
being almost the same.

And now the interesting part, this is the IR of **MAOP-5** driver computed
from a **40–35000 Hz** sweep:

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi6WwantHey8j1-DcvYSaA-f5Pkhw-UDWSUQpiXBR3PyEt3GepeJ3COXP64DXpAJxwVsFU2D1SxGJIVrA3Wdf3qkdYCebAZwH4dlARRLPgJnhe-E18U3I_MxT4EDCSkLKMNcPVwX1kzlO9f1CTnndD_mxvcC02k_4qJ9IvFCsQayxrJ63B2QtWQpr-kqaX2/w400-h205/Impulse-MA.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi6WwantHey8j1-DcvYSaA-f5Pkhw-UDWSUQpiXBR3PyEt3GepeJ3COXP64DXpAJxwVsFU2D1SxGJIVrA3Wdf3qkdYCebAZwH4dlARRLPgJnhe-E18U3I_MxT4EDCSkLKMNcPVwX1kzlO9f1CTnndD_mxvcC02k_4qJ9IvFCsQayxrJ63B2QtWQpr-kqaX2/s692/Impulse-MA.png)

The lack of damping is apparent here. Is it—is it good? Certainly not.
Initially I thought that perhaps this is a kind of "exotic" drivers that
promise "euphonic" non-linearities for a pleasant sound? I started
experimenting with the test setup: first I swapped the QA460 amp for the
same amp I'm actually using in my LXdesktop setup: QSC SPA4-100, but the IR
stayed the same. Then I started playing with the parameters of the sweep
and figured out that if I limit the high frequency range to the standard
**20 kHz** then the ringing is gone:

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgVZIGUL2GlBlI5GlHCynAUYzl9gAQU17tb-1dP6UIq5LkW1jpQMWmnK3ronkGx3ajWKsAs_aMmiCIcc-OORCOhVfJG8HWU5mvkKnNjirphLJdix6kfg_va8J7IS-kPvVK9Qwg7M8croPhhyCh-ARuEeX8FggQ6woR2T6MZJlIxFwl_6D_UDPb58Sl7gUS4/w400-h205/Impulse-MA-LP.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgVZIGUL2GlBlI5GlHCynAUYzl9gAQU17tb-1dP6UIq5LkW1jpQMWmnK3ronkGx3ajWKsAs_aMmiCIcc-OORCOhVfJG8HWU5mvkKnNjirphLJdix6kfg_va8J7IS-kPvVK9Qwg7M8croPhhyCh-ARuEeX8FggQ6woR2T6MZJlIxFwl_6D_UDPb58Sl7gUS4/s692/Impulse-MA-LP.png)

The IR still has more fluctuations than IRs of other drivers, but at least
now there are no high frequency modulations. I suppose, the stiff material
of the driver's cone causes it to go into very high frequency
oscillations. Although these should be above the human hearing, they still
can cause more non-linear behavior when excited. For this driver it is
strictly required to use a low-pass filter.

And below are pairwise comparisons of frequency responses of all drivers
corresponding to these IRs. In fact, the response of **MAOP-5** driver does
not change in the range of **40–20000 Hz** regardless of the sweep's upper
bound frequency:

These are "nearfield" responses so they are not super useful for evaluating
a dipole.  Still, we can see that **CA** driver is indeed a "midrange"
driver with a steep downwards slope after **10 kHz**, so it's clearly
unsuitable for use in LXmini-based designs.

There is an expected difference between **FU10RB** and **MU10RB-SL** in the
bass response, otherwise they are indeed very similar. And finally, this is
the comparison between **MAOP-5** and **FU10RB**:

We can see that the overall shapes of the frequency responses are close.
One interesting point is the high frequency behavior of these full range
drivers. Since all the cones operate in "break-up" mode, the material of
the cone affects the response a lot. We can see that both **MAOP-5** and
**W3-1878** have a null at about **9 kHz** in this arrangement, while both
SEAS drivers have two: near **5** and **7.5 kHz**.

## Distortion

Finally, the graphs we have been looking for. As I mentioned, the
distortion measurement is derived from the same logsweep, I did not use the
stepped sine method. But I have done the sweep at two SPL levels (as
measured near the driver cone): **105 dB** and **96 dB**. Below are the
measurements for each driver done at the higher level showing 2nd to 4th
harmonics (the levels of other harmonics are benign):

And the summary graph comparing them:

Looking at the graphs, almost all the drivers seem to be from the same
league—I do not see an obvious winner, but I do see an obvious loser: the
**CA** driver again. For others, as we know, **FU10RB** has higher
distortion levels in the midrange, and **MU10RB-SL** is not much better,
and it has these strange peaks between **2–3 kHz** and **3–4 kHz**,
although they are very sharp so likely not audible. **MAOP-5** driver has
issues in the **2–3 kHz** region, while **W3-1878** looks like the most
linear with the exception that distortion seriously increases past
**10 kHz**.

This is a comparative graph at the **96 dB** output level:

The peaks after **5 kHz** seem to be measurement artifact as I see them for
all drivers, it's just they are drowned in noise for other drivers but
clearly visible for **W3-1878** which was measured on a different day. I
suppose, for cleaner results I would need to use the stepped sine method.

## Conclusions

We can see that **MU10RB-SL** variation is not significantly better than
the original **FU10RB**, only a bit. While **W3-1878** driver can be
thought as a winner from the distortion level perspective, recall that it
has lower acoustic radiation efficiency, which means I might need to drive
it harder in order to achieve the desired loudness at the listening
position. So, it looks like in order to make the final decision I will need
to build one sample of LXdesktop with **MAOP-5** driver, one sample with
**W3-1878**, and compare them with my original LXdesktop speaker, with all
samples tuned to the same target, of course. That should be a fun
experiment, looking forward to it!
